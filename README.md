# SingularToPluralTransformation-in-GPT2-XL

The transformation of singular nouns to their plural forms in English can follow various patterns, ranging from simple suffix additions to more complex vowel changes. This study focuses on leveraging the GPT-2 XL model to understand the intricacies of these transformations. The model’s ability to predict plural forms is assessed by classifying singular nouns into four distinct categories: nouns ending with ”s,” nouns ending with ”es,” nouns with internal vowel changes, and nouns that remain the same in both singular and plural forms. By employing a series of ablation studies and attention analyses, the aim is to identify the internal circuits within the model that are responsible for these specific transformation tasks. The research also explores the impact of different sentence templates and the role of key structural components, such as layer normalization and attention heads, in enhancing or degrading the model’s prediction accuracy.
